# dccmonitor

This package is intended to assist data curators to check the status of metadata and documentation files uploaded via the [dccvalidator](https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/dccvalidator/) shiny application.

Currently, dccmonitor is a collection of functions to gather data of interest from files within a Synapse file view. The goal is to add a shiny app dashboard for viewing the information.

## Installation
